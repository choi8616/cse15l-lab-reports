# Lab Report 3 - Week 6

## Streaming ssh Configuration
My group decided to choose option 1 - Streamline ssh Configuration 




## 1. Config File
--------------------------------------------------------
> Description 

- Screenshot below shows my `.ssh/config` file opened in my device. I opened it by using the command `open ~/.ssh/config`
- "Host ieng6" in the config file refers to an alias that will be used as a shorten command when logging into the server
- "HostName" refers to the host of the server, which I will be logging in
- "User" refers to my course specific account name
- Overall, this config file works as a tool that optimizes the process of typing in general commands to log into the server
