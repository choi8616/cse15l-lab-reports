# Lab Report 5 - Week 10

## Two MarkdownParse Comparison 
In this lab report, I tested 652 different commonmark-spec tests for two different `mark-down-parse` repository - my own implementation and implementation provided
in lab 9. Then, using new commands learned during lab 9, I compared the outputs of those tests and found out the files that generate different outputs for two 
`mark-down-parse`. I chose two from them and found out what part of the coding leads to an incorrect output.





## How I found the test differences
To find the differences between the results for the tests, I first added the new `echo` commanmd in the provided `script.sh` file to easily distinguish which of the
652 files are having differences. 
Then, on `ieng6`, I copied the `test-files` folder and `script.sh` file from the repository provided in lab 9 to my own implementation. Then, I stored the results 
of the tests in each of the two text files - `result-choi.txt` and `results-joe.txt`.
